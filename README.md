# 1. What is Bootstrap?

Bootstrap is a ready-made CSS framework. Basically, it is a kind of construction kit with ready-made and dynamic design elements. Such a framework usually contains a collection of tools such as a grid layout, e.g. for responsive web design. Web typography is also an important part of such a framework. Very good and comprehensive documentation can also be found on the official website [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).


# 2. Download and integrate Bootstrap
The first step is to download Bootstrap, which you can do here [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). To get started, the finished version is sufficient, which is already ready for use with CSS, JavaScript and fonts.
